Electrostress Reduction

Scientists agree that EMFs (electromagnetic fields) are hazardous to human health at exposure levels commonly found today. 
 
2) What proof is there of harmful effects?
 
• EMFs are considered “possibly carcinogenic,” by WHO organisation and has been linked to cases of childhood leukaemia.

In addition, there is now a growing body of evidence (30 000 studies!) showing that long-term exposure to this kind of mobile phone radiation can indeed put your health in danger. 

Studies have linked mobile phone radiation and other types of radiation to issues like:

• Brain cancer
• Tumour growth on the auditory nerve
• Reduced male fertility
• Increased risk of seizures
• Chronic inflammation
• Tinnitus
• Migraines
• Cataracts
• Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system / fight or flight 
• Many other potential problems

3) What are the maximum safe exposure levels?



4) Radiation risk factors
• Proximity to the source of radiation
• Exposure time
• Number of devices we are exposed to

5) Schumann Resonances - Earth Frequencies

Neurobiological studies have shown that the fundamental frequency of the hippocampus, is in the range of the main Schumann frequency 7.83 Hz.

The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation.

Prof. Michael Persinger, who carried out research on behalf of NASA, was the first to realize that the absence of the Schumann frequency outside of the ionosphere led to significant physiological problems for the astronauts during the early manned space flights. 

He also realised that it was necessary to install specially designed Schumann generators for our spacecraft (Persinger 1967). 

Prof. Rütger Wever from the Max Planck Institute in Erling-Andechs, Germany conducted experiments with volunteers who had to spend a month in a magnetically shielded bunker. 

Participants in the study experienced a striking destabilization of the wake-sleep rhythm, daily body temperature and the cortisone level in the blood.

Scientific studies from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, USA, have shown that:

The Earth's magnetic field directly affects our brain. 

Magnetite crystals (Fe3O4) have been detected in the human brain that function like magnetic antennas and perceive the Earth's magnetic field. 

An American research team has shown that such crystals are abundant in the human brain. 

Similar biological magnets have now been found in a number of different animals. 

Magnetite crystals can also receive and respond to relatively weak signals.

6) What can make the Schumann frequency physiologically ineffective?

Due to electrosmog and the rapidly growing use of mobile phones, WiFi, Bluetooth technology, the radio, etc., the Schumann frequency is increasingly superimposed by other oscillation waves that are often stronger at a closer range. 

Therefore, our body seems to be less and less able to receive the waves from the earth's natural clock. This seems to be the reason that more and more vital functions in the body are becoming desynchronized (Hecht 2011, Mulligan & Persinger 2012). 

This is similar to the experiences of the first astronauts in space and is also similar to the evidence of astronomical disturbances on Earth (eg. solar storms) (Cherry 2002).
