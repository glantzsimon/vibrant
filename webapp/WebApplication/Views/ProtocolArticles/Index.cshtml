                <p>Not every protocol is appropriate for every person. Following a protocol that is not suitable could have unpredictable consequences and could make matters worse. Some protocols can be used individually, whereas others need to be used as part of a more comprehensive healing programme. The order in which some protocols are followed is very important.</p>
