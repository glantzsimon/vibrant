<h3 class="section-title">Vata Dosha</h3>

<p>
    Vata dosha is made up of air and space. It is responsible for all movement in the body, including that of the autonomous nervous system. Vata dosha people are typically flexibile and creative. Physically, vata body types are typically slim or even lanky and typically have dry skin and often have thin or frizzy hair. Vata types usually dislike cold and dry climates. When imbalanced, vata dosha can lead to scattered and racing thoughts. When in balance, however, it brings with it a great capacity to learn quickly (although long term mememory is not typically as strong as that of kapha dosha people), as well as creativity and multitasking.

<h4 class="bold">Vulnerabilities</h4>
<p>
    Unbalanced vata can be forgetful and flaky, struggling to stick to routines or complete projects. It is also more prone to instability and anxiety, especially when overwhelmed. Vata dosha people are the most vulnerable to the impact of stress. They also tend to have irregular eating and sleeping patterns and are prone to digestive issues.

<h4 class="bold">How to Balance Vata Dosha</h4>
<p>To balance out the vata dosha’s cold and dry characteristics, it's important to emphasise restorative, warming, and grounding routines:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Eat more grounding foods that are warm, moist and heavy; foods that are rich in protein and fat and have sweet, sour, and salty tastes, while avoiding dried and cold (especially frozen) foods.</li>
    <li>Increase intake of root vegetables, sweet and sour fruits, compatible grains, pulses, nuts and seeds (if applicable), 
    dairy (if compatible with genetic profile), compatible oils.
    <li>Decrease intake of cold, raw foods, yeasted bread, strong spices, caffeine, sugar.
    <li>Maintain a daily routine for meals, rest and sleep and stay well hydrated (this air-based dosha increases dryness)</li>
    <li>Avoid erratic or disruptive schedules and try to minimise travel as well as time spent on technology.</li>
    <li>Introducing consistency is key to this dosha’s equilibrium</li>
</ul>
