<h2>Type 3 - Teacher</h2>
<h3>
    Teachers are typically sinewy and flexible, with an amazing adaptability, the Teacher is a balance between opposing and often contradictory forces.
    Blessed with a tolerant immune system, the Teacher can be burdened by excess altruism, leading to problems finding and dealing with the bad guys.

    <li>Teachers show impressive recovery powers with dietary and lifestyle changes.</li>
    <li>Balance is key for Teachers in all aspects of life.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Vulnerabilities</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Sensitive digestive system</li>
    <li>Immune system can be overly tolerant</li>
    <li>Can become excessively detail-oriented</li>
    <li>Teacher's analytical quickness and adaptability can lead to mental imbalance when in poor health.</li>
    <li>Compulsive-type diseases may arise without balanced stress hormones, calming exercises, and proper diet.</li>
    <li>Substance abuse may exacerbate Teachers' issues with obsession and trivialities.</li>
    <li>Tolerance can be detrimental when it compromises one's well-being.</li>
    <li>Overworked Teachers may struggle with immune system exhaustion, leading to chronic infections.</li>
    <li>Teacher children often suffer from chronic ear and respiratory infections.</li>
    <li>Teacher's immune system is slow to activate, which can lead to vulnerability to infections and cancers.</li>
    <li>While tolerance is beneficial for migration, it may lower defenses against harmful elements.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Metabolic Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Teachers are typically ectomorphs or meso-ectomorphs with low body fat, high metabolism, and wiry physique.</li>
    <li>Characterized by discernible tendons and ligaments, indicating flexibility and strength.</li>
    <li>Many Teachers exhibit asymmetry, with different finger lengths on each hand.</li>
    <li>They tend to be of small to average height with balanced torso and leg lengths.</li>
    <li>While some exceptions exist, most Teachers are PROP "tasters" with blood type A and Rh-positive.</li>
    <li>They often have whorl-type fingerprints, indicating potential cancer risks, especially for women.</li>
    <li>Presence of six or more whorl patterns may necessitate proactive cancer prevention measures.</li>
    <li>The Teacher GenoType Diet and lifestyle program offers automatic support for cancer prevention.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Immune System Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Teacher's tolerant immune system may lower defenses against microbes, harmful foods, and aberrant cells.</li>
    <li>This increases vulnerability to infections and raises the risk for many common cancers.</li>
    <li>In Teachers, tumor cells often "turn off" suppressor genes, leading to cancerous growth.</li>
    <li>The Teacher GenoType Diet helps activate suppressor genes, aiding in cancer prevention.</li>
    <li>The crane exemplifies the Teacher's character, balancing acceptance and integration like the martial arts stance "crane on a rock."</li>
    <li>Like the crane, the Teacher embodies success in acceptance and integration, benefiting both individuals and the environment.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Teacher Diet</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Teachers' farming heritage predisposes them to metabolise a wide variety of fresh foods, grains, and seafood.</li>
    <li>They lack enzymes to digest and metabolize animal fat properly.</li>
    <li>The ideal Teacher Diet is vegetable- and seafood-based, with small amounts of other low-fat proteins.</li>
    <li>Excess meat consumption can lead to bacterial buildup in the digestive tract, hindering metabolism and immune function.</li>
    <li>This can cause stomach and intestinal issues like gastritis, leading to discomfort and nausea.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Optimal Foods</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Plant-based</strong></li>
    <li><strong>High-phytonutrient</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Do not promote bacterial overgrowth</strong></li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Superfoods and supplements that
            epigenetically reprogram their tolerant genes
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Help to keep their anticancer
            defense in top shape
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Optimise their metabolism</strong></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Have the nutritional building blocks needed for genetic improvement.</strong> These superfoods are rich in the gene-methylating nutrients such as vitamin B12, choline, and the amino acid methionine.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Increase muscle mass and decrease body fat.</strong> This improves the metabolic
        rate, which speeds up proper weight loss.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Minimise bacterial overgrowth</strong> These foods do not leave a carbohydrate
        residue in the digestive tract and therefore do not "feed” bad bacteria.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Keep the immune system vigilant and in top shape.</strong> Teachers need to keep
        their anticancer genes active. Usually this involves keeping their "tumorsuppressor genes" in tiptop shape. When working properly, these genes can help keep other cancer-inducing genes silent and inactive.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Clean up carcinogens and mutagens from the body.</strong> Cleaning up
        carcinogens requires a well-functioning liver and effective scavenging of carcinogens by special cells in the body called macrophages.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Avoid Foods That:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Encourage microbial growth.</strong> Many foods containing simple sugars and
        starches encourage bacterial overgrowth in the Teacher’s gut. This puts a strain
        on the Teacher’s overall immune efficiency.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Have an undesirable ratio of good to bad fats.</strong> An undesirable ratio of
        omega-6 to omega-3 fats can slow down your metabolism and interfere with the
        proper functioning of your immune system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Block your anticancer defenses.</strong> Teachers rarely require hormone therapy.
        More often, they require that something be done to restore sensitivity to their
        own hormones. Foods that interfere with optimal hormone function in the
        Teacher need to be avoided, especially in the early stages of the diet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inhibit the metabolism.</strong> Surprisingly, many of the foods that encourage
        bacterial overgrowth or block your genetic anticancer defenses also inhibit the
        metabolism and cause weight gain.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Exercise</h4>
<p>
    Teacher GenoTypes need regular, vigorous exercise to keep their metabolism in balance, increase endurance, and maximize their resistance. You’ll need to blend both demanding and less demanding exercises for a total of 40 minutes, 4–5 times weekly. Be sure to warm up for at least 5–10 minutes with some gentle stretching before beginning any aerobic activity.
