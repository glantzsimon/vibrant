<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>
    It should be emphasized that the one condition of all exercise for Explorers is the breaking of a sweat. If you are an Explorer and you do not sweat when you exercise, you are not exercising enough! To stay fit and healthy, reduce stress, and increase endurance, you’ll need about 40 minutes of exercise 4–5 times weekly. Be sure to warm up for at least 5–10 minutes with some gentle stretching before beginning any aerobic activity.
