<h2>Type 4 - Explorer</h2>
<h3>
    Muscular, quirky and adventurous, the Explorer is a biological problem-solver with an impressive ability to adapt to environmental changes and a better-than-average capacity for gene repair. The Explorer’s vulnerability to hormonal imbalances and brain strain can be overcome with a balanced diet and lifestyle.

</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Metabolic Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Explorers typically exhibit mesomorphic traits, with low to medium body fat, high metabolism, and ample muscle mass.</li>
    <li>They often have large bones and asymmetrical, chiseled facial features.</li>
    <li>Trunk length is usually longer than leg length, with longer upper legs than lower.</li>
    <li>Explorers tend toward asymmetry, with different fingerprint patterns on each hand and reversed finger lengths for their gender.</li>
    <li>Many left-handers are Explorers, as are individuals with Rh-negative blood type and "non-secretor" ABO blood types.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Immune System Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Explorers often have sluggish bone marrow function, leading to low white blood cell counts.</li>
    <li>They are prone to various types of anemia, including those from deficiencies in folic acid, B12, iron, and G6PD enzyme.</li>
    <li>G6PD enzyme deficiency impacts glutathione production, critical for liver detoxification and protecting red blood cells.</li>
    <li>Explorers struggle to clear foreign chemicals from their blood efficiently.</li>
    <li>Efficient acetylation aids drug effectiveness and detoxifies carcinogens.</li>
    <li>GT4 Explorers face challenges detoxifying drugs, carcinogens, and environmental pollutants.</li>
    <li>Chemically sensitive, Explorers often react negatively to standard medication doses and should start with low doses.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Explorer Diet</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Explorers who maintain a detoxifying diet can avoid health problems and maintain a healthy weight.</li>
    <li>They can modify genes causing poor detoxification in their lifetime and improve future generations' health forecasts.</li>
    <li>The right diet and lifestyle for their GenoType allows Explorers to care for both young and old.</li>
    <li>Food sensitivities and toxicity are best treated with proper foods for one's body, not just avoiding the wrong ones.</li>
    <li>The Explorer diet is akin to "Entry-Level Neolithic," bridging the gap between hunter-gatherer and agricultural eras.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Optimal Foods</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Superfoods and supplements that
            epigenetically reprogram their reactive genes
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Help to keep their detoxification
            mechanisms in top shape
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>
            Help optimize the metabolism, leading to
            increased energy and optimal weight
        </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Have the nutritional building blocks needed for genetic improvement.</strong> These superfoods are rich in gene-methylating nutrients such as vitamin B12, choline, the amino acid methionine, and the histone regulators curcumin, copper and biotin.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Increase muscle mass and decrease body fat.</strong> Detoxifying Explorers improves their metabolic rate, which speeds up proper weight loss.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Build up the blood.</strong> Explorers need nutrient-rich blood so they can maximize their oxygen-carrying capacity and keep their resistance up and energy levels in top shape. Foods rich in selenium, iron, and the B vitamin thiamine are Explorer superfoods.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Clean up toxins from the body.</strong> Cleaning up toxins requires a wellfunctioning liver and bile ducts. Explorers can get the job done better by eating plant foods that contain polysaccharide nutrients that help support these cells. The Explorer also benefits from foods that enhance the liver’s Phase I and Phase II detoxification pathways.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Avoid Foods That:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Contain toxins or molds.</strong> Many grains, nuts, seeds, and dairy products can interfere with the proper detoxification function in the Explorer. The Explorer diet minimizes your exposure to pesticides and other undesirable environmental toxins.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inhibit the metabolism.</strong> Not surprisingly, many of the foods that encourage toxic buildup in the Explorer also inhibit the metabolism and cause weight gain.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Have an undesirable ratio of good to bad fats.</strong> An undesirable ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats can slow down your metabolism and interfere with the proper functioning of your immune system.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Contain reactive lectins or other allergens.</strong> Lectins are proteins that can interfere with proper digestive and immune function. Phenols are plant compounds that cause allergic reactions in many Explorers.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Exercise</h4>
<p>
    It should be emphasized that the one condition of all exercise for Explorers is the breaking of a sweat. If you are an Explorer and you do not sweat when you exercise, you are not exercising enough! To stay fit and healthy, reduce stress, and increase endurance, you’ll need about 40 minutes of exercise 4–5 times weekly. Be sure to warm up for at least 5–10 minutes with some gentle stretching before beginning any aerobic activity.
