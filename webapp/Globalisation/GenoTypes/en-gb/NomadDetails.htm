    Nomad - a genetic profile of extremes, with a great sensitivity to environmental conditions—especially changes in altitude and barometric pressure.
</p>
<p>
    The Nomad is vulnerable to neuromuscular and immune problems. Yet a well-conditioned Nomad has the enviable gift of controlling calorie intake and aging gracefully.

<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>
    The Nomad exercise protocol is designed to increase muscle growth, enhance the metabolic functions, and reduce stress. Nomad GenoTypes do best with stretching and lengthening exercises that also have a resistance component to them. Try to exercise for 30–40 minutes at least 5 days per week, using a combination of the More and Less Demanding exercises, depending on your current level of physical conditioning. Be sure to do warm-up stretching for 5 minutes before you begin, and cool down with stretching for 5 minutes after you’ve finished.
