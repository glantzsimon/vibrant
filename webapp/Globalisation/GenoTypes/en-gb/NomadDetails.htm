<h2>Type 6 - Nomad</h2>
<h3>
    Nomad - a genetic profile of extremes, with a great sensitivity to environmental conditions—especially changes in altitude and barometric pressure.
    The Nomad is vulnerable to neuromuscular and immune problems. Yet a well-conditioned Nomad has the enviable gift of controlling calorie intake and aging gracefully.

<h4 class="section-title">Vulnerabilities</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Tends to keep emotions hidden</li>
    <li>Extremes and variables make diagnosis often challenging</li>
    <li>Sensitive digestive tract</li>
    <li>Often gluten intolerant</li>
    <li>Garbage removal via the immune system can become impaired when out of balance</li>
    <li>Tendency towards slow infections, such as chronic viral infections, warts or parasites</li>
    <li>Higher risk of neuromuscular disorders later in life</li>
    <li>Fatigues easily</li>
    <li>Loss of proper nitric oxide control can disrupt healthy aging for Nomads, affecting immune system, circulatory flow, and brain function.</li>
    <li>Proper diet and lifestyle are crucial for sustaining this Nomad function, as breakdowns often lead to various health issues as they age.</li>
    <li>Nomads are prone to slow-growing neurodegenerative diseases, often triggered by viral infections in youth but manifesting later in life.</li>
    <li>They have a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases like lupus, multiple sclerosis, and ALS.</li>
    <li>Problem areas for Nomads include the liver and spleen, leading to inflammatory liver disease, hepatitis, and cirrhosis.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Metabolic Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Nomads typically have large bones, with BMI and waist-to-hip ratios often higher due to muscularity rather than excess fat.</li>
    <li>They are commonly mesomorphs, with low to medium body fat, medium to large bone size, and a medium to high metabolism.</li>
    <li>Tall Nomads usually have broad, balanced facial features, while shorter ones have rounder jawlines.</li>
    <li>Fetal development of Nomads is influenced by altitude, with those in high-altitude areas tending to be taller and more symmetrical.</li>
    <li>Nomads often exhibit distinctive fingerprint patterns, including an abundance of ulnar loop patterns.</li>
    <li>Shorter Nomads may show asymmetry, such as differences in breast size for women and testicle size for men.</li>
    <li>Taller Nomads tend to be more symmetrical, indicating favorable conditions in the womb.</li>
    <li>Nomads with a high count of ulnar loop patterns and a family history of Alzheimer's disease may benefit from cognitive support as outlined in the Nomad Diet Plan.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Immune System Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Nomads, early herders, experienced rapid and continuous migration, exposing them to various climates and microbes.</li>
    <li>The adoption of horseback existence by Nomads revolutionized human mobility, allowing for extensive migrations.</li>
    <li>This rapid movement exposed Nomads to diverse microbes, contributing to their overly tolerant immune system.</li>
    <li>Mounted Nomads quickly encountered new dangerous microbes, leading to specific immune adaptations.</li>
    <li>Nomads may struggle with low-grade, chronic viral infections if their nitric oxide production is unbalanced.</li>
    <li>Sluggish immune response in Nomads can lead to persistent fatigue.</li>
    <li>Some Nomads may experience overactive immune responses, leading to autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
    <li>This overactive immune scenario is common in Nomads of African or Asian ancestry and those with specific fingerprint patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Nomad Diet</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Nomads may have sensitivities to lectins and gluten, making their diet more idiosyncratic.</li>
    <li>Some Nomads are adapted to fermented dairy products, while others may be lactose intolerant.</li>
    <li>The adaptation to herding and milking societies allowed Nomads to consume dairy throughout their lives.</li>
    <li>Signs of adaptation to milking societies include incisor shoveling and smaller teeth.</li>
    <li>Despite challenges, Nomads possess natural gifts and can thrive with a personalized approach to health.</li>
    <li>The GenoType Diet recognizes individuality, and Nomads exemplify this uniqueness.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Optimal Foods</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low-lectin</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Low-gluten</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Superfoods and supplements that epigenetically reprogram their thrifty genes</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Help to slow down the aging process</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Help optimize the metabolism, leading to increased energy and optimal weight.</strong></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Have the nutritional building blocks needed for genetic improvement.</strong> These superfoods are rich in gene-methylating nutrients such as vitamin B12, green tea, and histone regulators such as curcumin, ginseng, sage, and biotin.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Optimize the production and regulation of nitric oxide.</strong> Keeping the Nomad cardiovascular, immune, and nervous systems amply supplied with nitric oxide enhances their total function, since in Nomads the function of the three as a whole is greater than the sum of the parts. For the Nomad, foods high in the amino acids arginine and citrulline are NO superfoods.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Rebuild the gut lining.</strong> Nomads often have very compromised gut linings, often evidenced as white lines on their fingerprints. Foods rich in short-chain fatty acids and probiotics (friendly bacteria) will soon help the digestive tract rebuild itself.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Increase muscle mass and decrease body fat.</strong> Optimizing nitric oxide production in Nomads improves their metabolic rate, which speeds up proper weight loss.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Avoid Foods That</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cause hypoglycemia.</strong> Since low blood sugar can cause such debilitating fatigue in Nomads, you will want to maintain a diet that keeps your blood sugar levels within a narrow, optimal range.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inhibit your metabolism.</strong> Not surprisingly, many of the foods that cause hypoglycemia or that interfere with the proper functioning of nitric oxide in the Nomad also inhibit your metabolism and cause weight gain.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Irritate the gut.</strong> Many foods contain ingredients that can irritate the lining of the Nomad’s gut, causing fatigue and inflammation. Many mold-containing foods and fungi can cause increased inflammation in Nomads.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Contain gluten.</strong> Gluten is a protein found in many grains that can irritate the gut lining in sensitive individuals. If you are a Nomad and have discovered that you have white lines on your fingerprints, you’ll want to limit your intake of gluten-containing foods.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Exercise</h4>
<p>
    The Nomad exercise protocol is designed to increase muscle growth, enhance the metabolic functions, and reduce stress. Nomad GenoTypes do best with stretching and lengthening exercises that also have a resistance component to them. Try to exercise for 30–40 minutes at least 5 days per week, using a combination of the More and Less Demanding exercises, depending on your current level of physical conditioning. Be sure to do warm-up stretching for 5 minutes before you begin, and cool down with stretching for 5 minutes after you’ve finished.
