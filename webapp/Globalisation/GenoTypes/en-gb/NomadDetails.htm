    Nomad - a genetic profile of extremes, with a great sensitivity to environmental conditions—especially changes in altitude and barometric pressure.
</p>
<p>
    The Nomad is vulnerable to neuromuscular and immune problems. Yet a well-conditioned Nomad has the enviable gift of controlling calorie intake and aging gracefully.
