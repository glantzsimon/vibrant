<h4 class="section-title">Exercise</h4>
<p>
    The Warrior exercise protocol is designed to increase muscle growth, develop and strengthen the cardiovascular system, and offset the Warrior’s tendency to rapid aging. Warrior GenoTypes do best with stretching and lengthening exercises that also have a resistance component to them. Try to exercise for 30–40 minutes at least four days per week. Be sure to do warm-up stretching for 5 minutes before you begin, and cool down with stretching for 5 minutes after you’ve finished.
