<h2>Type 5 - Warrior</h2>
<p>
    Warrior are long, lean, and healthy in youth, but typically subject to a bodily rebellion in midlife.
</p>
<p>
    With the optimal diet and lifestyle, the Warrior can overcome the quick-aging metabolic genes and experience a second "silver age" of health.

    <li>Ages early and steadily</li>
    <li>Immunosuppression due to stress</li>
    <li>Insulin resistance</li>
    <li>Obesity</li>
    <li>Chronic digestive problems</li>
    <li>Cramps</li>
    <li>Bloating</li>
    <li>Hormone imbalances</li>
    <li>Warriors enjoy vitality through adolescence and young adulthood, but metabolic changes occur in midlife.</li>
    <li>Midlife brings an acceleration of aging processes, with weight gain and accumulation of belly fat.</li>
    <li>Waistlines thicken, jawlines recede, and BMI and waist-to-hip ratios increase steadily.</li>
    <li>Both men and women experience thinning hair and under-eye bags.</li>
    <li>The Warrior's cardiovascular system faces challenges, from skin conditions to blood pressure issues.</li>
    <li>Controlling blood viscosity becomes difficult, particularly under intense stress.</li>
    <li>Bowel function often declines in later life, causing constipation and discomfort.</li>
    <li>Proper diet and exercise can alleviate these symptoms and promote overall well-being.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Exercise</h4>
<p>
    The Warrior exercise protocol is designed to increase muscle growth, develop and strengthen the cardiovascular system, and offset the Warrior’s tendency to rapid aging. Warrior GenoTypes do best with stretching and lengthening exercises that also have a resistance component to them. Try to exercise for 30–40 minutes at least four days per week. Be sure to do warm-up stretching for 5 minutes before you begin, and cool down with stretching for 5 minutes after you’ve finished.

<h4>Metabolic Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Warriors' worldview stems from historical events, not environmental scarcity.</li>
    <li>They have high-growth-factor activity, long legs, and visible tendons.</li>
    <li>Warriors typically have oval faces and are not rounded, despite hearty appetites.</li>
    <li>They often belong to the A-blood-group antigen and may be non-tasters or super-tasters of PROP.</li>
    <li>Warriors often have tall stature and elongated heads.</li>
    <li>The arch fingerprint pattern is common among Warriors.</li>
    <li>They are usually fast-acetylators, prone to converting environmental toxins into carcinogens.</li>
    <li>Red meat consumption can lead to carcinogen production and increase cancer risk.</li>
    <li>Warriors are at risk for adult-onset diabetes due to their genetic predisposition.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Immune System Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Warriors exhibit excellent immune surveillance and quick recovery from illness.</li>
    <li>They often overcome cancer and heart attacks, metabolize drugs efficiently, and have low allergy susceptibility.</li>
    <li>Historically, Warriors survived urban life's plagues and pestilence, outlasting less resilient GenoTypes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Warrior Diet</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The Warrior GenoType, despite evolving as farmer-agrarian, produced formidable warriors throughout history.</li>
    <li>Unlike hunters, farmers were adept warriors due to their organization and assets to defend.</li>
    <li>A Mediterranean-style diet, rich in fish, oils, grains, vegetables, and fruits, suits Warriors best.</li>
    <li>Despite concerns about aging, Warriors can reclaim fitness and vitality with determination and the right plan.</li>
    <li>The Warrior GenoType Diet emphasizes a modified Mediterranean approach, focusing on plant-based, low-glycemic, high-phytonutrient foods.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Optimal Foods</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Superfoods and supplements
        that epigenetically reprogram their thrifty genes</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Slow down the aging process and help optimize the metabolism, leading to increased energy and optimal weight.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Have the nutritional building blocks needed for genetic improvement.</strong> These superfoods are rich in the gene-methylating nutrients such as vitamin B12, choline, and betaine, and the histone regulators curcumin, copper, and biotin.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Rich in hormone-balancing lignans.</strong> Lignans are sometimes referred to as phytoestrogens. However, this term is misleading. Many of the disease-fighting properties of lignans have nothing to do with any type of hormone activity. Lignans appear to offer the Warrior protection against many diseases, including hormone-dependent breast and prostate cancer, osteoporosis, cardiovascular
        disease, and inflammation. Major source of lignans are flaxseed, sesame seeds, and many fruits.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Increase muscle mass and decrease body fat.</strong> Balancing the hormones of the Warrior improves their metabolic rate, which speeds up proper weight loss. </li>
    <li><strong>Protect and nourish the arteries and heart.</strong> With age, many Warriors develop problems with their circulation. Foods rich in antioxidants called flavones help protect the delicate lining of the arteries from damage. Many of these flavones are found in tea, fruits, and vegetables.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Slow down the biologic clock.</strong> Other antioxidants, such as resveratrol, vitamin E, and selenium, may help control accelerated aging in the Warrior GenoType./li>
</ul>

<h4>Avoid Foods That:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Burn the arteries.</strong> Red meats and all sources of trans fats should be avoided. They cause arterial inflammation, thicken the blood, and accelerate the aging process in Warriors.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Inhibit the metabolism.</strong> Surprisingly, many of the foods that cause hormonal imbalance in the Warrior also inhibit the metabolism and cause weight gain.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Have an undesirable ratio of good to bad fats.</strong> An undesirable ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats can slow down the metabolism and interfere with the proper functioning of the immune system.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Are high-glycemic foods.</strong> High-glycemic foods produce large fluctuations in blood glucose and insulin levels. Avoiding these is the secret to reducing the risk of heart disease and diabetes and is the key to sustainable weight loss.
