<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>
    The Gatherer exercise protocol is designed to increase muscle growth, clear out toxins that are stored in body-fat tissue, and enhance insulin efficiency. Gatherer GenoTypes do best with stretching and lengthening exercises that also have a resistance component to them. Try to exercise for 30–40 minutes at least 6 days per week. Be sure to do warm-up stretching for 5 minutes before you begin, and cool down with stretching for 5 minutes after you’ve finished.
