<h2>Type 2 - Gatherer</h2>
<h3>
    Gatherers often have wonderful, warm, sensuous personalities. An affinity for home, hearth, people, and food makes them beloved friends and partners. Intellectually adventurous and are often among the first to adapt to new ideas and methods. Although easygoing, they are highly principled and often tenacious defenders of justice.

    <li>Fertile</li>
    <li>Typically ages well</li>
    <li>Good immunity</li>
    <li>Extreme thinness isn't ideal for Gatherers; they have a different mission than rapid weight loss.</li>
    <li>Genomic improvement is achievable through proper nourishment and lifestyle.</li>
    <li>Gatherers possess warm, sensuous personalities, nurturing and adaptable.</li>
    <li>They are intellectually curious, principled, and defend justice tenaciously.</li>
    <li>Social feedback influences Gatherers' attitudes, impacting their psychological profile.</li>
    <li>Historically, voluptuousness was revered; today, slender figures are often favored.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Vulnerabilities</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Prone to emotional highs and lows</li>
    <li>Struggles with motivation to exercise</li>
    <li>Struggles with appetite regulation</li>
    <li>Weight gain</li>
    <li>Estrogen dominance</li>
    <li>Accumulation of toxins in tissues</li>
    <li>Hypothyroidism</li>
    <li>The Gatherer's metabolic thriftiness, advantageous in ancient times, struggles in modern carb-rich diets.</li>
    <li>Gatherers efficiently store excess carbs and fats, leading to perpetual hypoglycemia.</li>
    <li>This perpetual hypoglycemia results in weight gain and reduces brain and muscle nutrient absorption.</li>
    <li>Gatherers may eat for comfort rather than hunger due to disrupted food-appetite relationship.</li>
    <li>Disturbances in carbohydrate regulation and insulin sensitivity can lead to metabolic Syndrome X and "diabesity."</li>
    <li>This can progress to artery disease, kidney disease, and premature aging.</li>
    <li>Gatherers often exhibit physical signs of thriftiness such as shorter stature and asymmetry.</li>
    <li>Lower leg length discrepancy is a characteristic sign of Gatherers due to inhibited growth factors.</li>
    <li>Asymmetry may also manifest in differing hand patterns and breast sizes, particularly in women.</li>
    <li>Many Gatherers face hypothyroidism, causing fluid retention, muscle weakness, and low body temperature.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Metabolic Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Often endomorphs but not necessarily overweight. Marilyn Monroe was an endomorph and was considered lush and voluptuous.</li>
    <li>Gatherers can age well with proper diet and lifestyle adjustments.</li>
    <li>Unchecked thriftiness or extreme diets can lead to long-term damage. Balance is key</li>
    <li>Cell surfaces in Gatherers may become compromised due to sugar and fat accumulation.</li>
    <li>Gatherers often exhibit gynic traits, such as long index fingers and narrow leg space.</li>
    <li>Many female Gatherers have a low waist-to-hip ratio, creating an "hourglass" figure, which is often considered very beautiful.</li>
    <li>Male Gatherers can also possess striking attributes, akin to Elvis Presley's presence in "Jailhouse Rock."</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Immune System Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Gatherers generally possess robust immune systems.</li>
    <li>However, they may be more prone to reproductive organ issues due to fetal estrogenic activity.</li>
    <li>Reproductive cancers may affect Gatherer women earlier in life.</li>
    <li>Efficient fat storage in Gatherers increases the risk of accumulating man-made chemicals called xenobiotics.</li>
    <li>Xenobiotics include drugs, carcinogens, and environmental pollutants.</li>
    <li>Periodic detoxification helps prevent complications from xenobiotic accumulation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Gatherer Diet</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Gatherers often struggle on weight-loss programs, experiencing negative effects.</li>
    <li>Extreme weight loss can leave Gatherers feeling miserable, with puffy, darkened eyes.</li>
    <li>Optimal dietary health for Gatherers involves eating sufficient, quality food.</li>
    <li>Gatherers must focus not only on calorie reduction but also on consuming healing foods.</li>
    <li>The Gatherer GenoType Diet provides guidance on selecting beneficial foods.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Optimal Foods</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High-protein</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Low-glycemic</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Superfoods and supplements that epigenetically reprogram their thrifty genes.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Help detox accumulated metabolic by-products.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Restore hormone receptor sensitivirty at the cellular level.</strong></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Have the nutritional building blocks needed for genetic improvement. </strong>These superfoods are rich in the vitamins, minerals, purines, and nucleotides
        from proteins and cultured foods.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Increase muscle mass and decrease body fat.</strong> This improves the metabolic
        rate, which speeds up proper weight loss.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cleanse the fat tissue of undesirable toxins.</strong> Gatherers can accumulate man-
        made (xenobiotic) toxins. We want to emphasize foods that help eliminate them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Enhance sensitivity to their metabolic-boosting hormones.</strong> This increases
        your metabolic rate, which speeds up proper weight loss.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Remove accumulated metabolic by-products from the cells.</strong> These foods
        contain ingredients that speed the removal of advanced glycation end products
        (AGE), the "burnt sugar" molecules that accumulate so easily in Gatherers as
        they grow old.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Avoid Foods That:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Slow down the Gatherer metabolism.</strong> Many grains, nuts, and seeds can
        interfere with the proper function of insulin, causing the Gatherer to lose weight
        with only the greatest difficulty
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Enhance the deposition of cellular debris.</strong> Foods known to enhance the
        production of AGEs are excluded from the Gatherer diet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Are high-glycemic foods.</strong> High-glycemic foods produce large fluctuations in
        blood glucose and insulin levels. Avoiding these is the secret to reducing your
        risk of heart disease and diabetes and is the key to sustainable weight loss.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Block proper hormone stimulation.</strong> Gatherers rarely require hormone
        therapy. More often, they require that something be done to restore sensitivity to
        their own hormones. Foods that interfere with optimal hormone function in the
        Gatherer need to be avoided, especially in the early stages of the diet.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Exercise</h4>
<p>
    The Gatherer exercise protocol is designed to increase muscle growth, clear out toxins that are stored in body-fat tissue, and enhance insulin efficiency. Gatherer GenoTypes do best with stretching and lengthening exercises that also have a resistance component to them. Try to exercise for 30–40 minutes at least 6 days per week. Be sure to do warm-up stretching for 5 minutes before you begin, and cool down with stretching for 5 minutes after you’ve finished.
