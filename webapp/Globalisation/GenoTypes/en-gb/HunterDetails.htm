<h2>Type 1 - Hunter</h2>
<h3>
    Often taller than average, slender and intense, with an overabundance of adrenaline and a fierce, nervous energy that calms down with age. Hunters are vulnerable to systemic burnout when overstressed and their modern challenge is to conserve energy for the long haul.

</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Metabolic Profile</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Exceptional metabolism among GenoTypes.</li>
    <li>Efficiently convert calories into muscle, bone, and fat.</li>
    <li>Physiques are designed for optimal use of athletic limbs.</li>

</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Immune System Profile</h4>

    <li>Proactive immune response (especially beneficial historically)</li>
    <li>Modern allergens can cause problems for reactive immune.</li>
    <li>Hyperreactivity leads to inflammation, contributing to several health issues.</li>
    <li>Excessive immune response can worsen conditions like arthritis and asthma.</li>
    <li>Inflammation can also increase obesity risk for non-ideal diets.</li>
    <li>Overactive immune system can become a weakness.</li>
    <li>Ideal diet aims to balance the immune system by reducing unnecessary hyperreactive responses.</li>
    <li>Type 1 people, surprisingly, show resilience against environmental chemicals.</li>
    <li>Individual reactivity is influenced by various pre-and postnatal factors.</li>
    <li>Urban upbringing, antibiotic use, and feeding methods impact level of reactivity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Hunter Diet</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The Hunter GenoType diet aids in weight loss and maintenance, thanks to its metabolism-friendly approach.</li>
    <li>Adopting the Hunter GenoType diet can effectively address weight issues caused by poor habits or inflammatory conditions.</li>
    <li>Hunters possess inherent resilience, which the Hunter diet helps activate to promote overall health.</li>
    <li>Individuals who haven't been eating right for their GenoType may experience damage to the lining of their digestive tract, a condition that can be reversed through proper dietary adjustments. </li>
    <li>Visible signs such as worn fingerprints with white lines may indicate damage to the digestive tract lining.</li>
    <li>The GenoType 1 Hunter diet is designed to restore the natural protective mechanisms of the gut, facilitating the reversal of damage and promoting digestive health.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Optimal Foods</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low-lectin</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Low-gluten</strong></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Help to repair and nourish the digestive tract.</strong> Many of these superfoods are rich in
        butyrate, a fatty acid known to exert a nutritive effect on the digestive tract.
        Butyrate also has highly desirable effects on gene function
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Help to handle stress better.</strong> Many of these foods include sterols found in plant foods
        and amino acids such as tyrosine found in meats. These nutrients control stress at
        both the physical and emotional levels.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Anti-inflammatory</strong> Foods that
        lower reactivity to allergens and lectins in the diet and balance the immune response.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Contain nutritional building blocks for optimal genetic expression. </strong> Foods such as prurines and nucleotides from protein and cultured foods</li>
    <li><strong>Increase muscle mass and decrease body fat</strong></li>
    <li>
        <strong>Are rich sources of tissue-protecting antioxidants.</strong> These phytochemicals
        mop up tissue-damaging free radicals and slow down the Hunter tendency
        towards rapid aging.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Avoid Foods That:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Slow down the Hunter metabolism.</strong> Many grains, nuts, and seeds can
        interfere with the proper function of insulin, causing even the normally lean
        Hunters to have difficulty keeping their weight down.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Are high in bad fats.</strong> Bad fats increase inflammation and can cause
        damage to the walls of the arteries. Trans fats are bad for the arteries; an
        undesirable ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats can increase the levels of
        inflammation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Are too high in simple sugars.</strong> High levels of sugars encourage bacterial
        overgrowth, which increases inflammation in the digestive tract.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Irritate the gut.</strong> Many foods contain ingredients that can irritate the lining of
        the Hunter’s gut, causing fatigue and inflammation. Many mold-containing
        foods and fungi can cause increased inflammation in Hunters
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Contain gluten, a lectin, or other allergens.</strong>  Gluten is a protein found in
        many grains that can irritate the gut lining in sensitive individuals. Chitinase is
        an enzyme that can initiate allergic reaction in the gut. It is found is some nuts
        and fruits. Lectins are proteins that can interfere with proper digestive and
        immune function. Phenols are plant compounds that cause allergic reactions in
        many Hunters.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="section-title">Exercise</h4>
<p>
    Type 1 people need regular, vigorous exercise to stay fit and healthy, reduce stress, and increase endurance. To accomplish this, about 40 minutes of exercise daily, or most days is ideal. It's important to warm up for at least 5–10 minutes with some gentle stretching before beginning any aerobic activity.
