Iboga has been sold in western world since 1901.
						Today, more and more advertising touts iboga as a “miracle cure” without any apparent regard as to the sustainability of the resource.
						Bought with gold, Iboga is then sold on the Internet in violation of laws protecting it, without equitable sharing of its benefits and a risk of consumers who have no certainty as to its origin and quality.
						The price of iboga has increased by over 1000% in 15 years making this fundamental Gabonese medicine too expensive for locals to buy.
