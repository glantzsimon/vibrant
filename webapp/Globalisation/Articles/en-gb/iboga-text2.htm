In what can only be described as biopiracy, more than a dozen patents have been filed regarding the therapeutic use of iboga and its chemical derivatives in total disregard of the Nagoya Protocol protecting the people behind this plant and knowledge.
The ivory trade and iboga trafficking are interlinked. Elephants love iboga fruit and the poachers track and kill them near the last wild reservations of iboga.
Once they have murdered the elephants, the poachers also take all the iboga found on site.
With your support, Blessings Of The Forest is committed to planting 10,000 feet of iboga wood in Akanda National Park in Gabon, for the benefit of the local people and also international research.
