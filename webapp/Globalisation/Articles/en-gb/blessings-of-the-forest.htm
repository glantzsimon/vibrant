	Iboga is now
	an endangered species, classified in July 2000 as a ‘National Cultural Heritage
	and Strategic Reserve’ by the Ex-President of Gabon, El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba.
	Our organisation has been set up to preserve, research and share knowledge about
	the medicinal plants and indigenous traditions of the Gabonese forest people for
	the benefit of all of humanity. We are a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-interest-companies-introduction">community interest company (CIC)</a>, which
	is a type of social enterprise. Like a charity, it has a stated mission known as
	the ‘community interest statement’ and a clearly defined set of activities. There
	are also restrictions on how it can spend its money. The ‘asset lock’ for a CIC
	states that it must reinvest any revenue that it generates in supporting its local
	community and furthering its mission.

	Blessings Of The Forest is committed to building a bridge between traditional Gabonese
	healers and researchers worldwide. We offer humanity the most sacred knowledge of
	the art of healing using one of the most sacred plants of our common historic origins.
	With your support, Blessings of The Forest is committed to planting 10,000 feet
	of iboga wood in Akanda National Park in Gabon, for the benefit of the local people
	and international research.
