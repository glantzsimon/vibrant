<h5>
    Everyone is unique
</h5>
<p>
    There are many people who promote a "one diet fits all" approach, whether it be keto, raw vegan, fruitarian, etc. At Pure Alchemy we believe that everyone is unique and requires a diet, supplementation and health regime taylored not only to their individual biology but also to their circumstances, such as the climate, time of year, lifestyle as well as their current state of health, age and other factors. For more details see <a href="{PersonalisedPlanLink}">Personalised Nutrition and Wellness Plan</a>.

<h5>
    If you are not getting the results you want, try something different
</h5>
<p>
    A lot of people stick to a particular diet, supplement programme and health regime for years, despite not getting the results they desire. In traditional naturopathy it is believed that, if something is not working, it is time to go back to basics and start over. The willingness to try new approaches, even if they seem to go against what we thought we knew, can be immensely rewarding.
