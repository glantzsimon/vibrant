    Teeth can tell a lot about a person's genetics. Incisor shovelling (where the incisors are spade-like) is more strongly associated with an ancestral history of herding or hunting, whereas the presence of Carabelli's cups is assocated with more agrarian ancestry. In each case, these features indicate key specific metabolic patterns.
