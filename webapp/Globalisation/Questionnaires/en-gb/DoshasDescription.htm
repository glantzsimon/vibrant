    The Ayurvedic "doshas" are patterns of Nature that can be easily observed in human beings. Everything is connected in the natural world. For example, our emotions and thoughts have a biochemical counterpart, in the form of neurotransmitters and neurohormones, giving rise to biochemical markers specific to certain emotional and mental states. That means that our personality, emotions and thoughts affect our biochemistry! Similarly, there is rich biochemistry influencing physical attributes, such as our skin, hair, metabolism, etc., which also influence our mind and emotions. It's all connected! The Ayurvedic doshas are a fascinating and deeply intuitive and informative system of understanding the whole person and their predisposition to specific imbalances.
