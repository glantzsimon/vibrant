    Your body type - also known as your somatotype - can tell us quite a bit about your metabolism and your genetic profile. This is a fairly easy question to answer, although I’m going to suggest you get a friend to confirm your results anyway. In our "thin is in" culture, lots of women consider themselves "rounded" when virtually everyone else would call them "muscular" or even "lanky." Similarly, many men who are muscular may mistakingly think they are thin.

<h4>Consider which of the following most resembles your body type:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ectomorph:</strong> You have a slim body type and are more likely small-framed, slender or lanky.</li>
    <li><strong>Ecto-mesomorph</strong> You have a more muscular, slim or athletic body type</li>
    <li><strong>Mesomorph:</strong> You have a more muscular body type or a medium build.</li>
    <li><strong>Meso-endomorph:</strong> You have a stocky, rounded, muscular body type.</li>
    <li><strong>Endomorph:</strong> You have a full-figured, stocky or rounded body type and are most likely large-framed</li>
</ul>
