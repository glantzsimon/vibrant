    Dermatoglyphics refers to the analysis of fingerprints in order to determine certain genetic markers. Our fingerprints correlate strongly to events in our epigenetic history and can therefore be used to determine a person's genetic profile and any associated susceptibility to specific imbalances.

As a general rule, the more your symmetry that exists between the left and right fingerprints (digit to digit), the less stress you experienced in the womb. This is because the left and right sides of the body develop separately in the womb, therefore the degree of stress experienced in utero tends to create varying degrees of assymetry between the two sides.
