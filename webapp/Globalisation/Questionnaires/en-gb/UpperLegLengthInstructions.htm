    Sit in a chair and place your fingertips on the kneecap of either leg. Slide your fingers upward until they are off the kneecap and your fingertips slide into the groove above the kneecap. Now look for the long skin crease between your hip and your leg. From this point, measure in a straight line to the groove on your knee. This is your upper-leg length.
