    Index-to-ring-finger or D2:D4 ratio is an excellent marker for sex hormone exposure. Higher levels of exposure to androgens in the womb correlates with longer ring fingers, whereas higher estrogen correlates with longer index fingers. The ration of hormones holds key information about a person's health and their ideal diet and lifestyle.
