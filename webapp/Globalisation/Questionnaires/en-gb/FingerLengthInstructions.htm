<h4>How to measure your index and ring fingers</h4>
<p>
    You may think you will be able to simply look at your hands and see at a glance which of your fingers is longer, but you’ll want to measure with your small ruler/ The index finger can often look longer than it is. Measure from the bottom of the crease where the palm starts and use the side of the finger closest to the middle finger (not the thumb or little finger). Try to get a measurement within 2-3 milimetres if possible.
