    A thrifty strategy responds to the environment in a cautious way, seeking not to confront threats but to avoid them where possible. It is a conservative approach based on self-preservation. A thrifty strategy is highly desirable in a world of shortage or scarcity, but it is poorly adapted to the luxuries of today’s widely available fats and sugars. Thrifty metabolic types respond to scarcity by slowing down their metabolisms—in particular, the way in which the cells respond to hormone stimulation. Thrifty types, when out of balance, often have normal levels of hormones yet show all the signs of hormone insufficiency. The outside of the cells get the proper hormone stimulation, but the inside of the cell can’t respond to it.
