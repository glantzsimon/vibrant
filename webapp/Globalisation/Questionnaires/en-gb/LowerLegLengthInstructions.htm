    Stand straight without shoes and have your assistant measure up the side of your leg, starting from the place where your ankle sticks out the farthest and ending at the bump on the outer side of your leg, just below your kneecap. If you’re carrying excess weight, you may have trouble finding the bump; if so, just flex your knee until you it can be felt.
