<h4>Fingerprint Analysis</h4>
<p>
    Many people find that they can clearly make out their fingerprints by using their phone's flashlight to shine light obliquely over them. This helps to highlight the grooves and make the finger more visible. Wearing a pair of reading glasses or using a magnifying glass also helps tremendously. Otherwise, If you still can't see your fingerprints clearly, you can also use a notary fingerprint kit, which you an buy online.

    Alternatively, you can create images of your fingerprints by downloading the "Finger Print Imager" app from the app store. You can find more info <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finger-print-imager/id1535871705" target="_blank">here</a>.

    For each digit, identify the type of fingerprint and select the appropriate value from the dropdown list. Repeat this for each hand.

    At first glance, your fingerprint patterns may seem random. What you’ll need to do, therefore, is to look for what’s known as a pattern area—the area within which you can actually see the pattern. Pattern areas are surrounded by type lines, ridges that basically outline the pattern.
