    A tolerant strategy is accepting and adaptable: "what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow, so don’t react too quickly - figure it out". This strategy is constantly adapting its responses to the environment, often by altering the binding sites, or receptors, that are found on the cells and tissues. Many of these receptors are used by microbes to attach to the tissues and organs. Sometimes this is harmonious (such as our relationship with the "good bacteria," or probiotics, in our digestive tract). Other times this is inharmonious (such as when there is some kind of infection). By readily adapting to the environment, both external and internal, one has more freedom to enjoy a wider variety of foods or to travel to new places comfortably. However, when out of balance, this comes with the risk of becoming overly tolerant to things that we don't want to tolerate, which can set the scene for problems later on.
