    Up until the Middle Ages, our heads got gradually wider and assumed more of a "blockhead" shape. From the Middle Ages onwards, our head shape appears to have been elongating and narrowing, in combination with a gradual increase in our height. Head shape reveals important information about the genetic profile of a person.

<h4>How to determine your head shape</h4>

<p>
    Use a soft tape measure and enlist the help of a friend. You’ll be measuring what anthropologists call the "cephalic index".
</p>
<h4><strong>How to determine your cephalic index</strong></h4>
<p>
    <strong>Head Width:</strong> Run the tape measure over the top of your skull at its widest point. (See the illustration for guidance).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Head Length:</strong> Measure the length of the head from the top of the forehead at the midline of your head (front in the illustration)down to the bony bump at the base of your skull (back in the illustration).
