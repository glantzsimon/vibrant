<p>A person's blood group is one of the most significant physical markers related to health that we have. It holds important information about their metabolism, genetics and the susceptibility to certain imbalances and diseases. The blood group also influences how our immune system reacts to certain lectins, glutens, etc. present in food, which affects levels of inflammation in the body. It also influences how our immune system responds to pathogens and other substances.</p>

    The Rhesus (or Rh) blood group system is not as widely distributed in the body fluids and tissues as the ABO blood groups. However, it is an important genetic and anthropological marker and is very useful determining the genetic profile of a person.
