<h4>How to measure your waist</h4>
<p>
    Wrap a soft tape measure around your waist at its narrowest point, just above the belly button. Make sure your tape measure is level all the way around your body and parallel to the floor. Gently tighten the tape measure until it’s snug but not so tight as to depress the skin. Try for an accuracy of within 0.5 centimetres.

<h4><strong>How to measure your hips</strong></h4>
<p>
    Wrap the tape measure around your hips, choosing the widest part of your hipbones.
