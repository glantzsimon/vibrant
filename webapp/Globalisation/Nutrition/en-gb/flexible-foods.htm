    We appreciate that eating right for your type and current state of health may leave you with far fewer foods than you would ideally like and <strong>this can seem very restrictive</strong>. However, it's <strong>typically only necessary to restrict problem foods when you are more vulnerable</strong> or have uncomfortable symptoms. We recommend being more cautious when, for example, you have an <strong>infection or are tired, run down, inflamed, very stressed or just generally feeling unwell</strong>.

    <strong>Once you start to recover and return to balance, you can safely start to open up your food choices again</strong>.We always recommend doing this <strong>slowly and carefully</strong>, to avoid a flare-up.
